# 🌱 Basic Machine Learning Projects

This repository will contain multiple beginner Machine Learning projects.  
For now, I have completed one project, and I will add more as I continue learning and building models.  
**So stay tuned — more projects coming soon!**

### 📂 Current Project

- 🚢 **Titanic Survivor Predictor** — Classification model that predicts survival of Titanic passengers

More projects will be added here as I work on them.
